# vim-plugin-minimal
A collection of minimal configs required to get started with popular vim plugin managers

Description
-----------
I use a lot of different servers and share dot files between them.  As I often use new
servers it can be frustrating to manually go through the process of installing a package
manager.  All these configs should drop in as a vimrc file and automatically install the
appropriate package manager with no user intervention.

Requirements
------------

| Manager  | curl | git |
| -------- | :--: | :-: |
| dein     | x    | x   |
| pathogen | x    | x   |
| vim-plug | x    | x   |
| vundle   |      | x   |
